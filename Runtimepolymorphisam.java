/*Polymorphism in java is a concept by which we can perform a single action by different ways. 
 * Polymorphism is derived from 2 greek words: poly and morphs. The word "poly" means many
 *  and "morphs" means forms. So polymorphism means many forms.

There are two types of polymorphism in java: compile time polymorphism and runtime
 polymorphism. We can perform polymorphism in java by method overloading and method overriding.
